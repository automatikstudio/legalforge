## Yes, Your Blog Needs a Privacy Policy

"But I just write blog posts. I don't sell anything or collect data." You'd be surprised. Almost every blog collects personal data — often without the blogger even realizing it.

If you use Google Analytics, have a comment system, use cookies, collect email addresses, display ads, or embed social media content, you need a privacy policy. And since virtually every blog does at least one of these things, a privacy policy is effectively required for all blogs.

## How Blogs Collect Data (Often Without Knowing)

### Analytics
If you use Google Analytics, Jetpack Stats, or any analytics tool, you're collecting:
- IP addresses
- Browser and device information
- Pages visited and time spent
- Geographic location (approximate)
- Referral sources

### Comments
If your blog allows comments (WordPress comments, Disqus, etc.), you collect:
- Commenter names
- Email addresses
- IP addresses (WordPress stores these by default)
- Comment content
- Website URLs (if provided)

### Email Subscriptions
If you have a newsletter or email signup form, you collect:
- Email addresses
- Names (if requested)
- Subscription preferences
- Email open and click data (through your email provider)

### Cookies
Your blog almost certainly uses cookies:
- Session cookies (WordPress login, cart)
- Analytics cookies (Google Analytics `_ga`, `_gid`)
- Advertising cookies (if running ads)
- Social media cookies (from embedded buttons/widgets)
- Comment cookies (WordPress stores commenter info in cookies)

### Advertising
If you run ads through Google AdSense, Mediavine, or any ad network:
- Advertising cookies track user behavior
- Ad networks collect user data for targeting
- Personalized ads require consent under GDPR

### Social Media Embeds
Embedding tweets, Instagram posts, YouTube videos, or Facebook posts means those platforms set cookies on your visitors' browsers and track their behavior.

### Hosting Provider Logs
Your web host (Bluehost, SiteGround, Cloudflare, Vercel, etc.) automatically logs:
- IP addresses
- Request timestamps
- Pages accessed
- Browser information

## What Your Blog's Privacy Policy Should Include

### 1. Your Identity
State who runs the blog and how to contact you for privacy inquiries.

### 2. Data Collection
List everything your blog collects. Be specific:
- Analytics data (which tool, what it collects)
- Comment data (names, emails, IPs)
- Email subscription data
- Cookie data (specific cookies and their purposes)
- Advertising data (if applicable)
- Hosting logs

### 3. Purposes
Explain why you collect each type of data:
- Analytics: to understand readership and improve content
- Comments: to enable community discussion
- Email: to send newsletters and updates
- Advertising: to monetize the blog and show relevant ads

### 4. Third-Party Services
Name every third-party service that processes visitor data:
- Google Analytics (analytics)
- Disqus or WordPress (comments)
- Mailchimp, ConvertKit, or Substack (email)
- Google AdSense, Mediavine (advertising)
- Cloudflare (CDN/security)
- YouTube, Twitter, Instagram (embedded content)

### 5. Cookies
Describe the cookies your blog uses, categorized by type (necessary, analytics, advertising). Include cookie names, providers, and duration.

### 6. User Rights
Outline what visitors can do:
- Request access to their data
- Request deletion of their data (comments, email subscriptions)
- Opt out of cookies
- Unsubscribe from emails
- Opt out of personalized advertising

### 7. Data Retention
State how long you keep data:
- Comments: until deleted by the commenter or blog owner
- Analytics: per your analytics tool's settings (Google Analytics default is 14 months)
- Email subscriptions: until the subscriber opts out
- Server logs: per your hosting provider's policy

### 8. Children's Privacy
If your blog could attract young readers, note that you don't knowingly collect data from children under 13 (COPPA) or 16 (GDPR).

## Creating Your Blog's Privacy Policy

You don't need a lawyer to create a blog privacy policy. [LegalForge](https://legalforge-chi.vercel.app) can scan your blog and generate a tailored privacy policy in about 60 seconds.

The AI detects your analytics tools, cookies, third-party scripts, and data collection forms, then creates a privacy policy that accurately reflects your blog's actual data practices. It's far more accurate than trying to manually identify everything.

## Where to Put Your Privacy Policy

### WordPress Blogs
1. Go to **Settings → Privacy** and create or designate a privacy policy page
2. Add the page to your footer menu under **Appearance → Menus**
3. Link to it near comment forms and email signup forms

### Blogger / Blogspot
1. Create a new page (not a post) titled "Privacy Policy"
2. Add a link in your blog's sidebar or footer widget

### Ghost, Substack, Medium
- Ghost: Create a page and add it to navigation
- Substack: Add a link in your About section and publication settings
- Medium: Link in your bio or publication About page

### Any Platform
Always link your privacy policy from:
- Your blog's footer (every page)
- Near comment forms
- Near email signup forms
- Your About page
- Your Google AdSense/Analytics setup (if required)

## Keeping Your Privacy Policy Updated

Review and update your privacy policy when you:
- Add or remove a commenting system
- Change analytics tools
- Start or stop running advertisements
- Add or remove email marketing
- Install new plugins or widgets that collect data
- Embed new types of third-party content

With [LegalForge](https://legalforge-chi.vercel.app), updating is easy — just rescan your blog whenever things change.

## Don't Skip This

A privacy policy might seem like overkill for a blog, but it's a legal requirement in most jurisdictions. More importantly, it shows your readers that you respect their privacy. It takes just a minute to generate one with [LegalForge](https://legalforge-chi.vercel.app) — there's no reason not to have one.
