## GDPR Isn't Just for Big Companies

When GDPR took effect in 2018, many small business owners assumed it only applied to tech giants and multinational corporations. That's a dangerous misconception. GDPR applies to any organization — regardless of size — that processes personal data of individuals in the European Union.

If your website is accessible to EU residents (which every website is), GDPR likely applies to you. The good news? Compliance doesn't have to be overwhelming or expensive. This guide breaks down exactly what small businesses need to do.

## What GDPR Requires: The Essentials

### 1. Know What Data You Collect

The first step is understanding your data landscape. Common personal data small businesses collect:

- Customer names and email addresses
- Billing information
- Website analytics data (IP addresses, browsing behavior)
- Cookie data
- Contact form submissions
- Newsletter subscribers
- Social media data from embedded widgets

Take inventory. You can't comply with privacy regulations if you don't know what data you're handling.

### 2. Have a Legal Basis for Processing

GDPR requires a lawful basis for every data processing activity. The most relevant for small businesses:

**Consent** — The individual has given clear consent. Use this for marketing emails and non-essential cookies.

**Contract** — Processing is necessary to fulfill a contract. Use this for processing orders, delivering services.

**Legitimate interest** — You have a legitimate business reason, balanced against the individual's rights. Use this for basic analytics, fraud prevention, and direct marketing to existing customers.

### 3. Create a Privacy Policy

Your privacy policy must meet GDPR's specific requirements (see our [guide to GDPR-compliant privacy policies](/blog/gdpr-compliant-privacy-policies)). At minimum, it must disclose:

- Your identity and contact information
- What data you collect and why
- Legal basis for each processing activity
- Who you share data with
- International data transfers
- Data retention periods
- Individual rights and how to exercise them

[LegalForge](https://legalforge-chi.vercel.app) can generate a GDPR-compliant privacy policy for your website in about 60 seconds by scanning your site to detect your actual data practices.

### 4. Implement Cookie Consent

Non-essential cookies (analytics, advertising, social media) require consent before being set. This means:

- Show a cookie consent banner before loading non-essential cookies
- Provide options to accept, reject, or customize cookie preferences
- Don't pre-check any consent boxes
- Make it as easy to reject as to accept
- Record consent for documentation

### 5. Respect Data Subject Rights

GDPR grants individuals several rights. You need a process to handle requests for:

- **Access** — Provide a copy of their data within 30 days
- **Rectification** — Correct inaccurate data
- **Erasure** — Delete their data when requested (with some exceptions)
- **Portability** — Provide their data in a machine-readable format
- **Objection** — Stop processing if they object (especially for marketing)

For most small businesses, these requests are infrequent. But you need a documented process ready.

### 6. Secure Your Data

GDPR requires "appropriate technical and organizational measures" to protect data. For small businesses, this means:

- Use HTTPS on your website
- Keep software and plugins updated
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Enable two-factor authentication
- Limit data access to those who need it
- Use encrypted email for sensitive communications
- Regularly back up your data

### 7. Have a Breach Response Plan

If a data breach occurs that risks individuals' rights, you must notify the relevant supervisory authority within 72 hours. You need:

- A process to detect breaches
- A plan for assessing severity
- Contact information for your supervisory authority
- A template for breach notifications
- A process for notifying affected individuals (when required)

## What Small Businesses Can Skip

Not everything in GDPR applies to every organization:

### Data Protection Officer (DPO)
You only need a DPO if your core activities involve large-scale monitoring of individuals or processing special categories of data. Most small businesses don't need one.

### Records of Processing Activities
Technically required for organizations with 250+ employees OR if processing is not occasional. In practice, keeping a simple spreadsheet of your data processing activities is smart even if not strictly required — it helps you stay organized and demonstrate compliance.

### Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs)
Only required for high-risk processing activities (large-scale profiling, systematic monitoring of public areas, etc.). Most small businesses don't need these.

## A Practical GDPR Compliance Checklist

Here's your action plan:

- [ ] Audit what personal data you collect and why
- [ ] Identify your legal basis for each processing activity
- [ ] Create or update your privacy policy ([use LegalForge](https://legalforge-chi.vercel.app))
- [ ] Implement cookie consent for non-essential cookies
- [ ] Add privacy policy links to all data collection forms
- [ ] Set up a process for handling data subject requests
- [ ] Review third-party services that process your data
- [ ] Enable HTTPS across your website
- [ ] Update software and implement basic security measures
- [ ] Create a simple data breach response plan
- [ ] Train any staff who handle personal data
- [ ] Document your compliance efforts

## Common Small Business Mistakes

**"GDPR doesn't apply to me because I'm not in the EU"** — If EU residents can access your website, GDPR applies.

**"I don't collect personal data"** — If you use Google Analytics, cookies, contact forms, or email signups, you do.

**"A cookie banner is enough"** — A banner alone isn't compliance. You need to actually block non-essential cookies until consent is given.

**"I can just add a checkbox that says 'I agree to everything'"** — GDPR requires specific, informed consent. Bundled consent for everything isn't valid.

**"I'll deal with it when someone complains"** — Regulators can initiate enforcement actions independently. Don't wait for a complaint.

## Getting Started Today

GDPR compliance doesn't have to be a massive project. Start with the basics:

1. **Generate your privacy policy** using [LegalForge](https://legalforge-chi.vercel.app) — it takes 60 seconds and covers GDPR requirements
2. **Add a cookie consent mechanism** to your website
3. **Review your data practices** using the checklist above
4. **Document everything** — GDPR values demonstrated accountability

Take it step by step, and you'll be compliant before you know it.
