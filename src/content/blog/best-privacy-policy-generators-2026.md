## Why Use a Privacy Policy Generator?

Creating a privacy policy from scratch requires legal expertise, time, and a thorough understanding of your data practices. For most businesses — especially startups and small businesses — hiring a lawyer to draft one costs $500 to $5,000 or more.

Privacy policy generators bridge this gap by producing legally-sound documents at a fraction of the cost and time. But not all generators are equal. Some produce generic templates that barely meet legal requirements, while others use AI to create tailored, comprehensive policies.

Here's our comparison of the best privacy policy generators available in 2026.

## What We Evaluated

We assessed each generator on five criteria:

1. **Accuracy** — Does the policy reflect your actual data practices?
2. **Compliance coverage** — Which regulations does it address (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)?
3. **Customization** — How tailored is the output to your specific website?
4. **Ease of use** — How quickly can you generate a policy?
5. **Price** — What does it cost?

## The Top Privacy Policy Generators

### 1. LegalForge — Best Overall

**Approach:** AI-powered website scanning

[LegalForge](https://legalforge-chi.vercel.app) takes a fundamentally different approach from traditional generators.

**Strengths:**
- Automatic website scanning eliminates guesswork
- Detects cookies, analytics, third-party scripts, and forms
- Generates tailored policies in about 60 seconds
- Covers GDPR, CCPA, and other major frameworks
- Also generates Terms of Service and Cookie Policies
- Free to use

**Best for:** Anyone who wants an accurate, tailored privacy policy without the hassle of questionnaires.
