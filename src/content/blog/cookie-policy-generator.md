## What Is a Cookie Policy?

A cookie policy is a document that informs your website visitors about the cookies and similar tracking technologies your site uses. It explains what cookies are, which specific cookies your site employs, what data they collect, and how visitors can manage their cookie preferences.

While a privacy policy covers your overall data handling practices, a cookie policy focuses specifically on cookies and tracking technologies. Some businesses include cookie information within their privacy policy, while others maintain a separate, dedicated cookie policy.

## Do You Need a Cookie Policy?

The short answer: if your website uses cookies, yes. And almost every website uses cookies.

Here's what triggers the requirement:

### EU ePrivacy Directive (Cookie Law)
If your website is accessible to EU users — which effectively means every website — you need to comply with the EU's cookie rules. This requires informing users about cookies before they're set and obtaining consent for non-essential cookies.

### GDPR
The General Data Protection Regulation classifies cookies as personal data identifiers. If you use cookies to track EU users, GDPR requires transparent disclosure and lawful basis for processing.

### CCPA
California's privacy law requires disclosure of tracking technologies used for data collection, including cookies used for advertising or analytics purposes.

### Common cookies that trigger the requirement:

- **Google Analytics** — Tracks user behavior with cookies like `_ga` and `_gid`
- **Facebook Pixel** — Uses cookies for ad targeting and conversion tracking
- **Session cookies** — Store login status and shopping cart contents
- **Advertising cookies** — Track users across sites for targeted advertising
- **Preference cookies** — Remember language settings, themes, or display preferences

## What Your Cookie Policy Should Include

A comprehensive cookie policy needs these elements:

### Definition of Cookies
Briefly explain what cookies are and how they work. Not all users understand the technology.

### Types of Cookies Used
Categorize your cookies:

- **Strictly necessary** — Essential for website functionality (login sessions, security tokens). These don't require consent.
- **Functional** — Remember user preferences (language, region). Enhance but aren't essential.
- **Analytics** — Track how users interact with your site (Google Analytics, Hotjar).
- **Advertising** — Track users for targeted advertising (Facebook Pixel, Google Ads).

### Specific Cookie Details
For each cookie, provide the name, purpose, provider, duration, and type. For example:

- `_ga` — Google Analytics — Distinguishes unique users — 2 years — Analytics
- `_fbp` — Facebook — Tracks visits across websites — 3 months — Advertising

### Third-Party Cookies
Identify third-party services that set cookies on your site and link to their respective privacy policies.

### How to Manage Cookies
Explain how users can control cookies through browser settings, your cookie consent banner, or opt-out links for specific services.

### Cookie Consent
Describe your cookie consent mechanism and how users can withdraw consent at any time.

## How to Generate a Cookie Policy

Creating a cookie policy manually requires auditing every cookie on your site — a tedious process that most people get wrong. Cookies change as you add new features, plugins, or integrations, making manual maintenance nearly impossible.

[LegalForge](https://legalforge-chi.vercel.app) automates this process. When you enter your website URL, LegalForge's AI scans your site to detect all cookies and tracking technologies in use. It then generates a detailed, compliant cookie policy that accurately reflects your site's actual cookie usage.

### The LegalForge Process

1. **Enter your URL** at [LegalForge](https://legalforge-chi.vercel.app)
2. **AI scans your site** for cookies, scripts, and trackers
3. **Review the generated policy** with detailed cookie tables
4. **Publish** on your website

This takes about 60 seconds, compared to the hours or days required for a manual cookie audit.

## Cookie Consent Banners

A cookie policy alone isn't enough for EU compliance. You also need a cookie consent mechanism — typically a banner that appears when users first visit your site.

Your consent banner should:

- **Appear before non-essential cookies are set** — Don't load analytics or advertising cookies until consent is given
- **Provide granular choices** — Let users accept or reject different cookie categories
- **Be easy to understand** — Avoid confusing dark patterns or pre-checked boxes
- **Allow easy withdrawal** — Users should be able to change their preferences at any time
- **Link to your full cookie policy** — For users who want more detail

## Common Cookie Policy Mistakes

### Not auditing regularly
Your cookie landscape changes every time you add a new tool, plugin, or integration. Audit your cookies at least quarterly.

### Ignoring third-party cookies
You're responsible for disclosing all cookies on your site, including those set by third-party scripts you've embedded.

### Bundling consent
Requiring users to accept all cookies or none violates GDPR. Provide granular category-based choices.

### Loading cookies before consent
A common technical mistake. Analytics and advertising scripts should only fire after the user has given consent.

### Using vague language
"We use cookies to improve your experience" isn't sufficient. Be specific about which cookies you use and why.

## Keep Your Cookie Policy Current

Cookie policies are living documents. Update yours whenever you:

- Add or remove a third-party service
- Change your analytics or advertising setup
- Modify how your site handles user sessions
- Enter new markets with different regulatory requirements

With [LegalForge](https://legalforge-chi.vercel.app), keeping your cookie policy current is easy — just regenerate it whenever your site changes. The AI will detect your current cookie landscape and produce an updated document.

## Next Steps

Don't wait for a complaint or fine to get your cookie policy in order. Use [LegalForge](https://legalforge-chi.vercel.app) to scan your website and generate a comprehensive, compliant cookie policy in seconds. It's free, fast, and accurate.
