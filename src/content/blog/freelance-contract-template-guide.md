# Freelance Contract Template: What Every Freelancer Needs in 2026

"We'll just shake on it" has ended more freelance relationships badly than any other phrase. Without a proper contract, you're one misunderstanding away from scope creep, payment disputes, or worse — legal trouble.

A freelance contract isn't about distrust. It's about clarity. This guide covers everything you need to include in your freelance contracts, plus common mistakes that cost freelancers thousands.

## Why Every Freelancer Needs a Contract

Let's be real: many freelancers skip contracts because:
- They feel awkward asking for one
- The project seems "small"
- The client "seems trustworthy"
- They don't know what to include

Here's what happens without a contract:

- Client adds "just one more thing" repeatedly (scope creep)
- Payment terms become fuzzy ("I'll pay you when I can")
- Ownership of work is disputed ("I paid for it, I own it all")
- Project drags on indefinitely with no end date
- You have no legal recourse when things go wrong

**A contract protects both parties.** Professional clients expect one. If a client resists signing a contract, that's a red flag, not a reason to skip it.

## Essential Clauses for Every Freelance Contract

### 1. Scope of Work (SOW)

This is the most important clause. Define exactly what you're delivering:

- Specific deliverables (not vague descriptions)
- Format and specifications
- Number of revisions included
- What's explicitly NOT included

**Bad example:** "Design a website"
**Good example:** "Design a 5-page marketing website including: homepage, about, services, contact, and blog index. Deliverables include Figma files and developer handoff specs. Three rounds of revisions included. Does not include copywriting, stock photos, or development."

The more specific your SOW, the fewer arguments later.

### 2. Payment Terms

Spell out everything about money:

- **Total project fee** or hourly rate
- **Payment schedule** (50% upfront, 50% on completion is standard)
- **Payment method** (bank transfer, PayPal, etc.)
- **Payment deadline** (Net 15? Net 30?)
- **Late payment penalties** (1-2% per month is standard)
- **Kill fee** (what you keep if they cancel mid-project)

Never start work without a deposit. 25-50% upfront is industry standard. If a client won't pay a deposit, they'll have trouble paying the final invoice too.

### 3. Timeline and Deadlines

Set clear expectations:

- Project start date
- Milestone deadlines (if applicable)
- Final delivery date
- Client feedback deadlines (this is crucial)
- What happens if deadlines slip (on either side)

Include a clause stating that project delays caused by late client feedback will push deadlines accordingly.

### 4. Revision Policy

Revisions are where scope creep lives. Define:

- How many revision rounds are included
- What counts as a "revision" vs. new work
- Cost for additional revisions
- Turnaround time for revisions
- When revision requests expire

Example language: "This project includes 2 rounds of revisions. A revision is defined as changes to approved concepts within the original scope. Requests to add new features, pages, or fundamentally change the project direction will be quoted separately."

### 5. Intellectual Property and Ownership

Who owns the work? When? Be explicit:

- **During project:** You retain ownership until final payment
- **After final payment:** Full rights transfer to client
- **Portfolio rights:** You retain the right to display work in your portfolio
- **Source files:** Are they included or separate?

This clause prevents disputes over usage and protects you if payment falls through.

### 6. Confidentiality (NDA)

Many clients work on projects they don't want public. Include:

- What information is considered confidential
- How long confidentiality lasts
- Exceptions (information that becomes public, etc.)
- Whether you can mention the client relationship

Keep this balanced. A reasonable NDA is fine; an overreaching one that prevents you from ever mentioning you worked together is a red flag.

### 7. Cancellation and Kill Fee

Projects get cancelled. Protect yourself:

- Client's right to cancel with written notice
- Kill fee structure (common: keep all deposits, plus bill for work completed)
- Your right to cancel (with reasonable notice)
- What happens to completed work if cancelled

Without this clause, you might complete 80% of a project and receive nothing when the client "changes direction."

### 8. Limitation of Liability

Protect yourself from being sued for more than the project is worth:

- Cap your liability at the project fee
- Exclude consequential damages
- Require disputes to go through mediation first

This prevents a $5,000 project from turning into a $500,000 lawsuit.

### 9. Independent Contractor Status

Make it clear you're not an employee:

- You're an independent contractor, not an employee
- You control your own schedule and methods
- You're responsible for your own taxes
- Client provides no benefits

This protects both parties from misclassification issues.

### 10. Dispute Resolution

How will you handle disagreements?

- Attempt good-faith negotiation first
- Mediation before legal action
- Which state/country's laws govern the contract
- Who pays legal fees

Many freelancers include a clause requiring disputes to be handled in their home jurisdiction. This prevents clients from dragging you to court across the country.

## Contract Red Flags to Watch For

When reviewing a client's contract, beware of:

- **Unlimited revisions** — This means the project never ends
- **Work-for-hire on everything** — You surrender all rights to concepts, sketches, and unused ideas
- **Non-compete clauses** — They can't prevent you from working with competitors
- **Payment "upon satisfaction"** — Too vague; satisfaction should be tied to specific deliverables
- **Ownership before payment** — Never transfer rights until you're paid in full
- **Unilateral termination** — They can cancel but you can't, with no kill fee

You can negotiate these terms. "I'd love to work with you, but I can't agree to unlimited revisions. How about we set a reasonable limit and I'll quote additional rounds separately?"

## How to Present Your Contract

Don't apologize for having a contract. Frame it professionally:

> "Before we kick off, here's my standard project agreement. It covers the scope we discussed, payment terms, and timeline. This protects both of us and ensures we're aligned. Take a look and let me know if you have questions."

E-signatures are legally binding. Use tools like DocuSign, HelloSign, or even a PDF signed and dated. Get it signed before starting any work.
