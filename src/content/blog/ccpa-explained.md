## What Is the CCPA?

The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), is one of the most comprehensive privacy laws in the United States. It gives California residents significant control over their personal information and imposes obligations on businesses that collect or process that data.

If you think CCPA only matters for businesses based in California, think again. The law applies based on where your customers are, not where your business is located.

## Does CCPA Apply to Your Business?

CCPA applies to for-profit businesses that collect personal information of California residents AND meet at least one of these thresholds:

- **Annual gross revenue** exceeds $25 million
- **Data volume** — Buys, sells, or shares personal information of 100,000 or more consumers, households, or devices
- **Revenue from data** — Derives 50% or more of annual revenue from selling or sharing consumers' personal information

Even if you don't currently meet these thresholds, understanding CCPA is important because:
- Your business may grow into the thresholds
- Other states are passing similar laws
- CCPA compliance practices overlap with GDPR, which has no size thresholds
- Consumer privacy expectations are increasing regardless of legal requirements

## What Counts as "Personal Information"?

CCPA's definition of personal information is broad. It includes:

- Names, email addresses, phone numbers
- IP addresses and online identifiers
- Browsing and search history
- Geolocation data
- Employment and education information
- Commercial information (purchase history)
- Biometric data
- Inferences drawn from any of the above to create a consumer profile

Essentially, any data that can identify, relate to, or be linked to a California resident or their household qualifies.

## Consumer Rights Under CCPA/CPRA

### Right to Know
Consumers can request that you disclose:
- What categories of personal information you collect
- The sources of that information
- Your business purposes for collecting it
- The categories of third parties with whom you share it
- The specific pieces of personal information you've collected about them

### Right to Delete
Consumers can request that you delete their personal information. You must comply and direct your service providers to do the same, with limited exceptions (completing transactions, security, legal obligations).

### Right to Opt-Out
Consumers can opt out of the sale or sharing of their personal information. You must provide a "Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information" link on your website.

### Right to Correct
Consumers can request correction of inaccurate personal information.

### Right to Limit Use of Sensitive Information
If you collect sensitive personal information (Social Security numbers, financial accounts, precise geolocation, etc.), consumers can limit your use to what's necessary for providing services.

### Right to Non-Discrimination
You cannot discriminate against consumers who exercise their CCPA rights — no denying services, charging different prices, or providing a different quality of service.

## What Your Business Needs to Do

### 1. Update Your Privacy Policy

Your privacy policy must disclose:
- Categories of personal information collected in the past 12 months
- Sources of that information
- Business purposes for collection
- Categories of third parties with whom you share data
- Consumer rights and how to exercise them
- Whether you sell or share personal information

[LegalForge](https://legalforge-chi.vercel.app) generates privacy policies that address CCPA requirements alongside GDPR and other frameworks.

### 2. Provide Opt-Out Mechanisms

If you sell or share personal information (including sharing data with advertising networks), you must:
- Add a "Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information" link to your website
- Honor opt-out requests promptly
- Respect Global Privacy Control (GPC) browser signals

### 3. Handle Consumer Requests

Establish a process to receive and respond to consumer requests:
- Provide at least two methods for submitting requests (e.g., web form and email)
- Verify the identity of requesters
- Respond within 45 days (extensions possible for complex requests)
- Provide information free of charge (up to twice per year)
- Keep records of requests and responses for 24 months

### 4. Review Data Sharing Practices

Audit your third-party relationships:
- Which services receive your users' personal information?
- Are any of these relationships considered "sales" or "sharing" under CCPA?
- Do you have appropriate contracts with service providers?

### 5. Train Your Team

Ensure anyone who handles consumer inquiries understands CCPA requirements and can direct consumers to the right resources.

## CCPA Fines and Enforcement

The California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA) enforces CCPA/CPRA. Penalties include:

- **$2,500** per unintentional violation
- **$7,500** per intentional violation or violations involving minors
- **Private right of action** for data breaches resulting from failure to implement reasonable security measures (statutory damages of $100-$750 per consumer per incident)

These amounts apply per violation, per consumer. A data breach affecting thousands of California residents can result in massive exposure.

## CCPA vs. GDPR: Key Differences

- **Scope** — GDPR applies to all data processing of EU residents; CCPA has business size thresholds
- **Legal basis** — GDPR requires a legal basis for processing; CCPA focuses on transparency and opt-out
- **Consent model** — GDPR is opt-in for many activities; CCPA is primarily opt-out
- **Fines** — GDPR fines scale higher (up to €20M / 4% revenue); CCPA fines are per-violation
- **Private right of action** — CCPA allows individual lawsuits for breaches; GDPR generally relies on regulatory enforcement

## Getting Started with CCPA Compliance

1. **Determine if CCPA applies** to your business (check the thresholds)
2. **Map your data flows** — understand what personal information you collect and where it goes
3. **Update your privacy policy** — use [LegalForge](https://legalforge-chi.vercel.app) for a compliant baseline
4. **Add required links** — "Do Not Sell or Share" if applicable
5. **Set up request handling processes**
6. **Review service provider contracts**
7. **Train relevant staff**

Even if CCPA doesn't currently apply to your business, implementing these practices positions you well for the growing wave of US state privacy laws. [Start with your privacy policy](https://legalforge-chi.vercel.app) — it's the foundation of compliance.
