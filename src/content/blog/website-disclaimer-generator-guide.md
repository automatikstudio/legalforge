# Website Disclaimer Generator: Create Free Legal Disclaimers in Minutes

You've got your privacy policy sorted. Your terms of service are in place. But there's another piece of legal protection many website owners overlook: disclaimers.

Unlike privacy policies (which are legally required in most jurisdictions), disclaimers aren't always mandatory. But they can save you from lawsuits, regulatory fines, and a world of legal headaches. The question is: which disclaimers does your site actually need?

In this guide, we'll walk through the most important types of website disclaimers, who needs them, and how to generate professional disclaimers for free using our [disclaimer generator](/).

## What Is a Website Disclaimer?

A disclaimer is a legal statement that limits your liability by clarifying what your website content is—and isn't. It tells visitors what they can and cannot expect from your site, and protects you if they misinterpret or misuse your information.

Think of it this way: a privacy policy tells visitors what you do with their data. Terms of service establish the rules of using your site. A disclaimer tells visitors what your content is for and what risks they assume by relying on it.

## The 7 Most Important Types of Disclaimers

### 1. General Disclaimer

**Who needs it:** Everyone with a website

A general disclaimer is your baseline protection. It typically covers:

- Information accuracy (you try to be accurate but can't guarantee it)
- No warranties about the site or its content
- External links don't equal endorsement
- Content may change without notice

**Example language:**
> The information on this website is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. [Company Name] makes no representations about the accuracy, reliability, or completeness of any information on this site.

### 2. Affiliate Disclaimer

**Who needs it:** Anyone earning affiliate commissions

If you participate in affiliate programs (Amazon Associates, software referrals, etc.), the FTC requires you to disclose this relationship. An affiliate disclaimer:

- Discloses that you may earn commissions
- Explains how affiliate relationships work
- Maintains trust with your audience

This isn't optional—the FTC actively enforces these requirements, and violations can result in significant fines.

**Example language:**
> This site contains affiliate links. If you click through and make a purchase, we may receive a commission at no additional cost to you. This helps support our work and allows us to continue providing free content.

### 3. Medical Disclaimer

**Who needs it:** Health, fitness, wellness, and nutrition websites

If your content touches on anything health-related, you need a medical disclaimer. This includes:

- Fitness and workout advice
- Diet and nutrition content
- Mental health and wellness topics
- Health product reviews
- General health information

Without a medical disclaimer, you could be liable if someone follows your advice and experiences negative health outcomes.

**Example language:**
> The content on this website is for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always seek the advice of your physician or other qualified health provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition.

### 4. Legal Disclaimer (Not Legal Advice)

**Who needs it:** Legal blogs, self-help legal sites, business advice sites

If you write about legal topics without being a licensed attorney (or even if you are, but aren't representing the reader), you need to clarify that your content isn't legal advice.

**Example language:**
> The information provided on this website does not, and is not intended to, constitute legal advice. All information, content, and materials available on this site are for general informational purposes only. Readers should contact an attorney to obtain advice with respect to any particular legal matter.

### 5. Financial Disclaimer

**Who needs it:** Investment, personal finance, and business sites

Similar to medical and legal disclaimers, financial disclaimers protect you from liability when you discuss money matters.

**Example language:**
> The content on this website is for educational purposes only and should not be construed as financial advice. Before making any investment or financial decisions, you should consult with a qualified financial advisor who can consider your individual circumstances.

### 6. Testimonial Disclaimer

**Who needs it:** Anyone displaying customer testimonials or results

If you feature testimonials, case studies, or before/after results, you need to set realistic expectations. The FTC requires that testimonials reflect typical results, or you must clearly disclose that results aren't typical.

**Example language:**
> Testimonials featured on this website are individual experiences and represent the personal opinions of those who have used our products/services. Results may vary and are not guaranteed to be the same for everyone.

### 7. Views Expressed Disclaimer

**Who needs it:** Multi-author blogs, company blogs with employee contributors, user-generated content sites

If multiple people contribute content to your site, clarify that their views don't necessarily represent the company.

**Example language:**
> The views and opinions expressed in blog posts, articles, and comments are those of the individual authors and do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of [Company Name].

## How to Display Disclaimers on Your Website

You have several options for where to place your disclaimers:

### Dedicated Disclaimer Page

Create a standalone disclaimer page (yoursite.com/disclaimer) that contains all your disclaimers. Link to it from your footer alongside your privacy policy and terms of service.

**Best for:** Comprehensive coverage, professional appearance

### In-Content Disclaimers

Place relevant disclaimers at the top or bottom of specific content. A medical disclaimer at the top of health articles, an affiliate disclaimer before product reviews.

**Best for:** Contextual relevance, user clarity

### Footer Disclaimers

Include a brief disclaimer statement in your site footer that appears on every page.

**Best for:** Constant visibility, space-limited situations

### Pop-up or Banner Disclaimers

For high-risk content, consider requiring users to acknowledge a disclaimer before viewing.

**Best for:** Maximum legal protection, sensitive content

**Our recommendation:** Use a combination approach. Maintain a comprehensive disclaimer page, add contextual disclaimers to relevant content, and include a brief footer notice.

## Disclaimer Best Practices

### Be Specific

Generic disclaimers are less effective than specific ones. Instead of "we're not responsible for anything," specify exactly what you're not responsible for and why.

### Use Plain Language

Legalese-heavy disclaimers might seem more "official," but they're less likely to be read and understood. Write in clear, plain language that your average visitor can comprehend.

### Keep Them Updated

Laws change. Your business changes. Review your disclaimers annually to ensure they still reflect your current situation and legal requirements.

### Make Them Findable

A disclaimer hidden in your terms of service isn't as effective as one that's easily accessible. Make sure visitors can actually find your disclaimers.

### Don't Overreach

Disclaimers can't exempt you from everything. Gross negligence, fraud, and intentional harm generally can't be disclaimed away. Don't rely on disclaimers as a substitute for actually being careful with your content.

## Industry-Specific Disclaimer Requirements

Different industries have different regulatory requirements:

**E-commerce:** Product liability disclaimers, shipping/delivery disclaimers, return policy integration

**Healthcare:** HIPAA considerations, state medical board requirements, FDA disclaimer requirements for supplements

**Financial Services:** SEC, FINRA, and state regulations often mandate specific disclosure language

**Education:** Accreditation disclaimers, outcome disclaimers for courses and programs

**Real Estate:** Fair housing disclaimers, MLS data source attributions

If you're in a regulated industry, consider having your disclaimers reviewed by an attorney familiar with your sector's requirements.

## Common Disclaimer Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Copying from another site.** Your disclaimer should reflect your specific situation, not someone else's.

**Mistake 2: Using a disclaimer as a substitute for good practices.** No disclaimer protects you if you're deliberately spreading misinformation or harming users.

**Mistake 3: Placing disclaimers where no one sees them.** Buried in your terms of service at paragraph 47 isn't effective placement.

**Mistake 4: Forgetting to update after changes.** Added an affiliate program? Started a health section? Your disclaimers need to reflect that.

**Mistake 5: Having no disclaimers at all.** Even a basic general disclaimer is better than nothing.
